# 🎯 CS2 Config

This repository contains my personal configuration files for **Counter-Strike 2**.  
It includes settings for gameplay optimization, custom binds, viewmodels, crosshairs, and performance tweaks.

## 📂 Contents

- `autoexec.cfg` — Main auto-executed commands
- `video.txt` — Graphics settings
- `crosshair.cfg` — Crosshair presets
- `viewmodel.cfg` — Viewmodel and bob settings
- `binds.cfg` — Custom key binds (buy binds, jump throw, etc.)

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place the `.cfg` files inside your CS2 config folder:
```
.../Counter-Strike Global Offensive/game/csgo/cfg/
```
2. Add `+exec autoexec.cfg` to your CS2 launch options for auto-loading.

## 🎮 Features

- Optimized FPS and network settings
- Custom crosshair and viewmodel for better visibility
