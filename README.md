# 🎯 CS2 Config

This repository contains my personal configuration files for **Counter-Strike 2**.  
It includes my custom `autoexec.cfg` and a snapshot of my video settings.

## 📂 Contents

- `autoexec.cfg` — Main auto-executed commands and settings
- `video.png` — Screenshot of my in-game video settings

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place the `autoexec.cfg` file inside your CS2 config folder:
```
.../Counter-Strike Global Offensive/game/csgo/cfg/
```
2. Add `+exec autoexec.cfg` to your CS2 launch options for it to load automatically.
